# Product Vision

## Goals

- Myanmar-first Hotel PMS that meets or exceeds top-10 global PMS quality.
- Optimize front desk flow: fewer clicks, faster check-in/out, clear status visibility.
- Provide auditability, role control, and local compliance readiness.

## Problem Statement

- Existing PMS tools in the market are slow, difficult to operate, or not localized.
- Hotels need a system that reduces front desk errors and speeds up check-in/out.
- Owners need consistent reporting and secure role-based access.

## Success Metrics

- Check-in time under 60 seconds for standard bookings (p95).
- Daily audit completion under 10 minutes.
- Less than 1% billing corrections per month.
- Training time for new staff under 2 days.
- System uptime 99.9% (monthly).
- Page load under 2 seconds (p95) for core pages.

## Target Users

- Front desk agents
- Reservation managers
- Housekeeping supervisors
- Cashiers and accountants
- Property admins

## Differentiators

- Myanmar-first UX and language defaults
- Simple, consistent UI for non-technical operators
- ABAC-based access control for precise permissions
- Offline-tolerant front desk workflows
- Operational speed and auditability as first-class design goals

## Product Principles

- Operational speed over visual complexity.
- Every action should be reversible or auditable.
- Consistent page layout and predictable navigation.
- Build for low-bandwidth and unstable networks.

## Scope (v1)

- Core PMS features: reservations, front desk, billing, housekeeping, reporting.
- Myanmar-first language and currency handling.
- Single property per deployment.

## Non-Goals (v1)

- Restaurant, Spa, KTV modules
- Smart-lock integration
- Multi-property chains

## Assumptions

- Hotels have a stable local network with intermittent internet.
- Front desk operations require quick keyboard-driven workflows.
- Property is within a single legal/tax jurisdiction.
